# Full Working OpenEMR Demo

We offer 3 fully functional demo installations for you to try out. Some simple
configuration has been added for clearer demonstration of OpenEMR, medical
billing, accounting, access controls and patient portals. Each demo is reset
overnight (PST) so no data is persistent. Note there are 3 identical demos
('Main', 'Alternate', 'Another Alternate') offered in case a demo is down or has
been modified. We also offer a [OpenEMR 5.0.0 demo with the most recent patch
and a full panel of Development Demos](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Development_5.0.0_Demo)
(these are demos that are rebuilt daily from most recent development code) where
you can test out new features.
